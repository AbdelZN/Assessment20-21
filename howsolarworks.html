                <p>
                    Solar energy begins with the sun. Solar panels (also known as "PV panels") are used to convert light from the sun, which is composed of particles of energy called "photons", into electricity that can be used to power electrical loads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Solar panels can be used for a wide variety of applications including remote power systems for cabins, telecommunications equipment, remote sensing, and of course for the production of electricity by residential and commercial solar electric systems.

                <p>
                    A charge controller, charge regulator or battery regulator limits the rate at which electric current is added to or drawn from electric batteries. It prevents overcharging and may protect against overvoltage, which can reduce battery performance or lifespan and may pose a safety risk. It may also prevent completely draining ("deep discharging") a battery, or perform controlled discharges, depending on the battery technology, to protect battery life.[2][3] The terms "charge controller" or "charge regulator" may refer to either a stand-alone device, or to control circuitry integrated within a battery pack, battery-powered device, or battery charger.

                    DC power
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Direct current (DC) power uses electrons that move in a straight line. This linear movement, in contrast to AC’s wave motion, gives this current its name. This form of current comes from batteries, solar cells, fuel cells, alternators equipped with commutators that create direct energy, and rectifiers that convert from AC to DC power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because DC power is so consistent in the voltage delivered, most electronics require this power type. That’s why most electronics have DC power sources in the form of batteries or need to convert AC power from the outlets to DC power through a rectifier.

                    Inverter 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    An inverter, is a power electronic device or circuitry that changes direct current to alternating current. 
                    The input voltage, output voltage and frequency, and overall power handling depend on the design of the specific device or circuitry. The inverter does not produce any power; it is provided by the DC source.
                    An inverter can be entirely electronic or may be a combination of mechanical effects (such as a rotary apparatus) and electronic circuitry. Static inverters do not use moving parts in the conversion process.
                    Power inverters are primarily used in electrical power applications where high currents and voltages are present.

                    AC power
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Alternating current (AC) power is the standard electricity format that comes out of outlets. The name comes from the waveform the current takes. To understand the composition of the AC wave, you need to understand that electrical currents come from a flow of electrons. As the electrons in an AC wave move, they can move in a positive direction, which corresponds to the upward part of the sinusoidal wave created by the current. When the electrons have a negative flow, the wave drops down.
